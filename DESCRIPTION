Description: Implements the Goldilocks adaptive trial design for a time to event
    outcome using a piecewise exponential model and conjugate Gamma prior
    distributions. The method closely follows the article by Broglio and
    colleagues <doi:10.1080/10543406.2014.888569>, which allows users to explore
    the operating characteristics of different trial designs.

\title{Simulate enrollment times}
\usage{
enrollment(param, N_total, time = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{param}{vector. Rate parameter(s) for Poisson distribution.}

\item{N_total}{integer. Value of total sample size.}

\item{time}{vector. Knots (of \code{length(param)} - 1) indicating end of
time when a specific lambda is used.}
}
\value{
A vector of enrollment times (from time of first patient enrollment)
in days.
}
\description{
Simulate enrollment time using a piecewise Poisson distribution.
}
\details{
Subject recruitment is assumed to follow a (piecewise stationary)
Poisson process. We assume trial recruitment to be an independent process,
thus the 'memoryless' property modeling of subject recruitment is used.
Since the subject recruitment rate can vary over time, we can account for
differential rates over time. Note that the first trial enrollment is
assumed to occur at time zero.

To illustrate, suppose we use a piecewise function to specify the change in
enrollment rate over time:

\deqn{
    \lambda = \left\{
      \begin{array}{ll}
        0.3 & \text{time} \in [0, 5) \\
        0.7 & \text{time} \in [5, 10) \\
        0.9 & \text{time} \in [10, 15) \\
        1.2 & \text{time} \in [15, \infty) \\
      \end{array}
    \right.
}

Then, to simulate individual patient enrollment dates with a sample size
(\code{N_total}) of 50, we use

\code{enrollment(param = c(0.3, 0.7, 0.9, 1.2), N_total = 50, time = c(5, 10, 15))}

This function was ported from the
\href{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bayesCT/index.html}{\code{bayesCT}}
R package.

\examples{
enrollment(param = c(0.003, 0.7), 100, time = 10)
enrollment(param = c(0.3, 0.5, 0.9, 1.2, 2.1), 200, c(20, 30, 40, 60))
}

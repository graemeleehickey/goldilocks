\arguments{
\item{hazard_treatment}{vector. Constant hazard rates under the treatment arm.}

\item{hazard_control}{vector. Constant hazard rates under the control arm.}

\item{cutpoint}{vector. Default is \code{cutpoint = 0}.}

\item{N_total}{integer. Maximum sample size allowable}

\item{lambda}{vector. Enrollment rates across simulated enrollment times. See
\code{\link{enrollment}} for more details.}

\item{lambda_time}{vector. Enrollment time(s) at which the enrollment rates
change. Must be same length as lambda. See
\code{\link{enrollment}} for more details.}

\item{interim_look}{vector. Sample size for each interim look. Note: the
maximum sample size should not be included.}

\item{end_of_study}{scalar. Length of the study; i.e. time at which endpoint
will be evaluated.}

\item{prior}{TODO}

\item{block}{scalar. Block size for generating the randomization schedule.}

\item{rand_ratio}{vector. Randomization allocation for the ratio of control
to treatment. Integer values mapping the size of the block. See
\code{\link{randomization}} for more details.}

\item{prop_loss_to_followup}{scalar. Overall proportion of subjects lost to
follow-up.}

\item{alternative}{character. The string specifying the alternative
hypothesis, must be one of \code{"greater"} (default), \code{"less"} or
\code{"two-sided"}.}

\item{h0}{scalar. Null hypothesis value of \eqn{p_\text{treatment} -
p_\text{control}}. Default is \code{h0 = 0}.}

\item{futility_prob}{scalar \code{[0, 1]}. Probability threshold to stop
early for futility.}

\item{expected_success_prob}{scalar \code{[0, 1]}. Probability threshold to
stop early for expected success.}

\item{prob_ha}{scalar \code{[0, 1]}. Probability threshold of alternative
hypothesis.}

\item{N_impute}{integer. Number of imputations for Monte Carlo simulation of
missing data.}

\item{N_mcmc}{integer. Number of samples to from the posterior
distribution.}

\item{debug}{logical. If \code{TRUE} can be used to debug aspects of the
code. Default is \code{debug = FALSE}.}

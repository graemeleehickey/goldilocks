\title{Posterior event estimates at endpoint time from posterior hazard
distributions}
\usage{
haz_to_prop(post, cutpoint, end_of_study, single_arm)
}
\arguments{
\item{post}{array An array of posterior probabilities of the piecewise hazard
rates (\eqn{\lambda_j}, for \code{j=1, \dots, J}) estimated by
\code{\link{posterior}}. The array has dimension 3. The first dimension is
of length \code{N_mcmc}, the second dimension is of length \eqn{J} (one
column for each hazard piece), and the third dimension is of length 2, with
the first slice including posterior samples from \code{post_treatment}, and
the second slice including posterior samples from \code{post_control}.}

\item{cutpoint}{vector. Default is \code{cutpoint = 0}.}

\item{end_of_study}{scalar. Length of the study; i.e. time at which endpoint
will be evaluated.}

\item{single_arm}{logical. If \code{TRUE}, trial is single arm. Else, if
\code{FALSE}, it is a randomized two-arm trial.}
}
\value{
A data frame with 3 columns of posterior samples:

\describe{
\item{\code{p_treatment}}{
The posterior probabilities of the event for the treatment arm.}
\item{\code{p_control}}{
The posterior probabilities of the event for the control arm.}
\item{\code{effect}}{
The posterior distribution of the treatment effect.}
}
}
\description{
The posterior distribution of the probability of an event
determined for a fixed time can be calculated in closed-form using the
piecewise exponential distribution and a sample from the posterior
distribution of the piecewise exponential hazard constant hazard rates.

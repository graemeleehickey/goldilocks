\title{Posterior event estimates at endpoint time from posterior hazard
distributions}
\usage{
haz_to_prop(post, cutpoint, end_of_study, single_arm)
}
\arguments{
\item{post}{list. A list of posterior probabilities of the piecewise hazard
rates (\eqn{\lambda_j}, for \code{j=1, \dots, J}) estimated by
\code{\link{posterior}}. The list has two data frame elements:
\code{post_treatment} and \code{post_control}. Each data frame is of length
\code{N_mcmc} (see \code{\link{survival_adapt}}) and has \eqn{J} columns --
one column per each constant hazard piece.}

\item{cutpoint}{vector. Default is \code{cutpoint = 0}.}

\item{end_of_study}{scalar. Length of the study; i.e. time at which endpoint
will be evaluated.}

\item{single_arm}{logical. If \code{TRUE}, trial is single arm. Else, if
\code{FALSE}, it is a randomized two-arm trial.}
}
\value{
A data frame with 3 columns: the posterior probabilities of the event
for the \code{treatment} arm, the posterior probabilities of the event for
the \code{control} arm, and the posterior distribution of the treatment
\code{effect}.
}
\description{
The posterior distribution of the probability of an event
determined for a fixed time can be calculated in closed-form using the
piecewise exponential distribution and a sample from the posterior
distribution of the piecewise exponential hazard constant hazard rates.

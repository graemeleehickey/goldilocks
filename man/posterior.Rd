\title{Posterior distribution of piecewise exponential constant hazard rates}
\usage{
posterior(data, cutpoint, prior, N_mcmc, single_arm)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{data frame. Minimum requirements are 3 columns: event time
(\code{time}), indicator of the event (\code{event}), and indicator for
treatment arm (\code{treatment}). Other columns can be included in the data
frame and will be handled in the split.}

\item{cutpoint}{vector. Default is \code{cutpoint = 0}.}

\item{prior}{vector. The prior distributions for the piecewise hazard rate
parameters are each \eqn{Gamma(a_0, b_0)}, with specified (known)
hyper-parameters \eqn{a_0} and \eqn{b_0}. The default non-informative prior
distribution used is Gamma(0.1, 0.1), which is specified by setting
\code{prior = c(0.1, 0.1)}.}

\item{N_mcmc}{integer. Number of samples to from the posterior
distribution.}

\item{single_arm}{logical. If \code{TRUE}, trial is single arm. Else, if
\code{FALSE}, it is a randomized two-arm trial.}
}
\value{
A list of two data frame elements: \code{post_treatment} and
\code{post_control}. Each data frame is of length \code{N_mcmc} and has
\eqn{J} columns -- one column per each constant hazard piece.
}
\description{
Using the Beta-Gamma conjugacy property, the posterior
distribution of the piecewise hazard rates (\eqn{\lambda_j}, for \code{j=1,
  \dots, J}) is calculated and sampled from.

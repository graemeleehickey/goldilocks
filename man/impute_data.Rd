\title{Impute incomplete data set with event times conditional on observed
data}
\usage{
impute_data(data_in, hazard, end_of_study, cutpoint, type, single_arm)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_in}{data frame. The time-to-event data that requires imputation,
with columns for treatment arm (\code{treatment}, which can be all 1s if
single-arm), event time (\code{time}), event indicator (\code{event}),
indicator of whether the subject requires imputation for expected success
(\code{subject_impute_success}) or futility
(\code{subject_impute_futility}).}

\item{hazard}{array. Hazard parameters for the piecewise exponential
distribution. This will most likely be a single sample from a posterior
distribution. A single slice of the array is passed, meaning it must have
dimensions 1 (rows), \eqn{J} (columns), and 2 (third dimension, in order of
treatment and control).}

\item{end_of_study}{scalar. Length of the study; i.e. time at which endpoint
will be evaluated.}

\item{cutpoint}{vector. Default is \code{cutpoint = 0}.}

\item{type}{character. Whether imputation is for \code{success} or
\code{futility}.}

\item{single_arm}{logical. If \code{TRUE}, trial is single arm. Else, if
\code{FALSE}, it is a randomized two-arm trial.}
}
\value{
A data frame with the same number of rows (number of subjects), but
with imputed event times.
}
\description{
Imputes the incomplete time-to-event data with event times from
a piecewise exponential model conditional on what is already observed. This
can be applied to any input data frame, whether for expected success,
futility, or final analysis imputation.

\details{
This function is not intended to be used outside of the main
simulation programs: \code{\link{survival_adapt}} and
\code{\link{sim_trials}}.
